# Transaction Service
Keeps track of transactions sent via Gnosis Safe contracts. It uses events and [tracing](https://wiki.parity.io/JSONRPC-trace-module).

Transactions are detected in an automatic way, so there is no need of informing the service about the transactions as in
previous versions of the *Transaction Service*

## Setup
This is the recommended configuration for running a production Transaction service. `docker-compose` is required
for running the project.

Configure the parameters needed on `.env`. These parameters **need to be changed**:
- `ETHEREUM_NODE_URL`: Http/s address of a ethereum node. It can be the same than `ETHEREUM_TRACING_NODE_URL`.
- `ETHEREUM_TRACING_NODE_URL`: Http/s address of a Ethereum Parity node with
[tracing enabled](https://wiki.parity.io/JSONRPC-trace-module).

If you need the Usd conversion for tokens don't forget to configure:
- `ETH_UNISWAP_FACTORY_ADDRESS`: Checksummed address of Uniswap Factory contract.
- `ETH_KYBER_NETWORK_PROXY_ADDRESS`: Checksummed address of Kyber Network Proxy contract.

For more parameters check `base.py` file.

Then:
```bash
docker-compose build --force-rm
docker-compose up
```

The service should be running in `localhost:8000`. You can test everything is set up:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/about/'
```

For example, to set up a GÃ¶erli node:

Run a Parity node in your local computer:
```bash
parity --chain goerli --tracing on --db-path=/media/ethereum/parity --unsafe-expose
```

Edit `.env` so docker points to he host Parity:
```
ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=http://172.17.0.1:8545
ETHEREUM_TRACING_NODE_URL=http://172.17.0.1:8545
```

Then:
```bash
docker-compose build --force-rm
docker-compose up
```
