First, we need to fund the proxy with the amount of DAI we want to invest:

```jsx
await dai.methods.transfer(cpk.address, daiAmount).send({ from: address })
```

Second, we need to prepare an array of transactions to execute for the Contract Proxy Kit:

```jsx
const txs = [
      {
        operation: CPK.CALL,
        to: DAI_ADDRESS,
        value: 0,
        data: dai.methods.approve(CDAI_ADDRESS, daiAmount).encodeABI()
      },
      {
        operation: CPK.CALL,
        to: CDAI_ADDRESS,
        value: 0,
        data: cDai.methods.mint(daiAmount).encodeABI()
      }
    ]
```

And then we simply execute it by calling `execTransactions` on the CPK instance:

```jsx
await cpk.execTransactions(txs)
```

`execTransactions` will return an object with [promiEvent](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.5/callbacks-promises-events.html#promievent) property you can use to subscribe for updates.
