First, we need to initialize the DAI and Compound DAI token contracts instances, the ABI can be found [here](https://github.com/gnosis/cpk-compound-example/blob/master/src/abis/CErc20.json):

```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from "react"
import cERC20Abi from "src/abis/CErc20.json"

interface ICompoundForm {
  web3: any
  address: string
  cpk: CPK
}

const DAI_ADDRESS = '0x5592EC0cfb4dbc12D3aB100b257153436a1f0FEa'
const CDAI_ADDRESS = '0x6D7F0754FFeb405d23C51CE938289d4835bE3b14'

const BLOCKS_PER_YEAR = (365.25 * 24 * 3600) / 15
const DECIMALS_18 = 10 ** 18

const CompoundForm: React.FC<ICompoundForm> = ({ web3, address, cpk }) => {
  const dai = useMemo(() => new web3.eth.Contract(cERC20Abi, DAI_ADDRESS), [
    web3
  ])
  const cDai = useMemo(() => new web3.eth.Contract(cERC20Abi, CDAI_ADDRESS), [
    web3
  ])

  return <div />
}
```

Let's write a function that will fetch the data required for investment calculations and save them into our state variables:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react"
import BigNumber from "bignumber.js"

const CompoundForm: React.FC<ICompoundForm> = ({ web3, address, cpk }) => {
  ...
  const [cDaiSupplyAPR, setCDaiSupplyAPR] = useState<string>("0")
  const [daiBalance, setDaiBalance] = useState<number>(0)
  const [cDaiLocked, setCDaiLocked] = useState<number>(0)

  const getData = async () => {
    // supply rate
    const cDaiSupplyRate = await cDai.methods.supplyRatePerBlock().call()
    const res = new BigNumber(cDaiSupplyRate)
      .times(BLOCKS_PER_YEAR)
      .div(DECIMALS_18)
      .times(100)
      .toFixed(2)
    setCDaiSupplyAPR(res)

    // dai Balance of user's connected wallet
    const daiBalance = await dai.methods.balanceOf(address).call()
    setDaiBalance(daiBalance)

    // current dai locked 
    const daiLocked = await cDai.methods.balanceOfUnderlying(cpk.address).call()
    setCDaiLocked(daiLocked)
  }
  ...
  return <div />
}
```

Notice that in <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`daiLocked`</span> we use the address of a proxy because in the result proxy will hold the locked funds. The proxy contract will be deployed when you first initiate the transaction with it, but the address is available by accessing the <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`address`</span> property of the CPK instance even when it's not deployed yet.
