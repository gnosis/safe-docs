This service allows us to have owners of the Safe contract that don’t need to hold any ETH on those owner addresses. How is this possible? The transaction relay service acts as a proxy, paying for the transaction fees and getting it back due to the transaction architecture we use. It also enables the user to pay for ethereum transactions using **ERC20 tokens**.

Our target user holds crypto in a centralized exchange (or on another Ethereum address) and wants to move it to a secure account. We don’t want the user to trust us, for moving the funds and deploying the smart contract on their behalf. We on the other side want to prevent users from spamming our services, there shouldn't be a need to trust the user either. The process for this is described in the [contracts deployment section](contracts_03_deployment.md).

## Setup

**For development (using ganache)**

This is the recommended configuration for developing and testing the Relay service. <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`docker-compose`</span> is required for running the project.

Configure the parameters needed on <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`.env_ganache`</span>. By default the private keys of the accounts are the ones from
Ganache, and the contract addresses are calculated to be the ones deployed by the Relay when the application starts,
so there's no need to configure anything.

More parameters can be added to that file like:
- <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`SAFE_FIXED_CREATION_COST`</span>: For fixed price in wei for deploying a Safe. If you set <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`0`</span> you allow Safes to be
deployed for free.
- <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`SAFE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`</span> to change the Safe's master copy address.
- For more parameters check <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`base.py`</span> file.

Then:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml build --force-rm
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

**For production**

This is the recommended configuration for running a production Relay. <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`docker-compose`</span> is required
for running the project.

Configure the parameters needed on <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`.env`</span>. These parameters **need to be changed**:
- <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`ETHEREUM_NODE_URL`</span>: Http/s address of a ethereum node.
- <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`SAFE_FUNDER_PRIVATE_KEY`</span>: Use a private key for an account with ether on that network. It's used to deploy new Safes.
- <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`SAFE_TX_SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY`</span>: Same as the <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`SAFE_FUNDER_PRIVATE_KEY`</span>, but it's used to relay all transactions.

Another parameters can be configured like:
- <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`SAFE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`</span>: If you are not using default Gnosis Safe Master Copy.
- <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`SAFE_FIXED_CREATION_COST`</span>: For fixed price in wei for deploying a Safe. If you set <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`0`</span> you allow Safes to be
deployed for free
- For more parameters check <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`base.py`</span> file.

Then:
```bash
docker-compose build --force-rm
docker-compose up
```

**Types**

<span style="color:#DB3A3D">`address`</span> - hexadecimal string which represents an address with checksum and 0x prefix
<span style="color:#DB3A3D">`hex`</span> - hexadecimal string starting by 0x prefix
<span style="color:#DB3A3D">`stringified-int`</span> - stringified int, base 10

**/api/v3/safes/ POST**

Creates new Safe Creation Transaction with random signature, generated by user and server, so no one knows the private key of the deployer address.

**Note:** We don’t use a Chain ID to facilitate testing on different chains (cf. [EIP-155](https://github.com/Ethereum/EIPs/issues/155). We don’t need the replay protection,
as the [ProxyFactory](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxies/ProxyFactory.sol) will deploy the Safe with the owners configured.
The only "attack vector" would be deploying a user Safe in another network for free in case it hadn't been deployed before.
The [Proxy](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxies/Proxy.sol) is used in this process.
Furthermore, we use "fast" from our gas station. Payments can use <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`ether`</span> or supported ERC20 tokens setting <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`paymentToken`</span>. The payment will be returned in wei.

More info about the signature values in appendix F of the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).

*Request:*

```js
{
    "owners": ["<address>"],
    "threshold": "int", // Min: 1 - Max: length(owners)
    "saltNonce": "stringified-int", // random Uint256. Same `saltNonce`, `threshold` and `owners` will always deploy the same Safe
    "paymentToken": "<address>", // optional, address of ERC20 token that should be used for paying the contract deployment
}
```

*Returns:*

HTTP 201

```js
{
    "deployer": "<address>",
    "funder": "<address>",
    "gasEstimated": "<stringified-int>", // it’s what the service gets as refund
    "gasPriceEstimated": "<stringified-int>", // it’s what the service gets as refund
    "masterCopy": "<address>",
    "payment": "<stringified-int>", // it’s what the service gets as refund
    "paymentReceiver": "<address>", // if NULL_ADDRESS (0x00...000) receiver would be the address sending the transaction
    "paymentToken": "<address>", // if no gasToken was specified in the request this will be address(0) for ETH
    "proxyFactory": "<address>",
    "safe": "<address>",
    "setupData": "<hex>",  // Setup data that will be used as `initializer` for the ProxyFactory `createProxyWithNonce` method
}
```

 HTTP 400 not valid values submitted

**Note:** Gnosis Safe contracts can be found on [releases](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/releases)

Clients should verify the server’s response with the following process:
1. Verify that <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`paymentReceiver` </span>is *NULL_ADDRESS*.
2. Verify that <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`proxyFactory`</span> and <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`masterCopy`</span> addresses are right.
3. Call [calculateCreateProxyWithNonceAddress](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxies/ProxyFactory.sol#L94) in the
[ProxyFactory](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxies/ProxyFactory.sol) using the <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`saltNonce`</span> provided in the request, <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`masterCopy`</span> and <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`setupData`</span>.
as initializer to check that the returned address should be equal to <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`safe`</span>.
4. Decode <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`setupData`</span> using [GnosisSafe](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol#L76) <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`setup`</span> method and check:
   - <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`fallbackHandler`</span> address is right.
   - <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`owners`</span> and <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`threshold`</span> match the ones provided.
   - <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`payment`</span> is not abusive and <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`paymentReceiver`</span> is *NULL_ADDRESS*.
   - <span style="color:#DB3A3D"> `paymentToken`</span> should be the one provided or *NULL_ADDRESS* in case it was not.
   - <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`to`</span> and <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`data`</span> must be empty in the current implementation. <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`to`</span> and <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`data`</span> could be used, for instance to give permission to a <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`Safe Module`</span> to access your funds.

If all checks pass, then Safe address is valid and the user can transfer at least the <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`payment`</span> amount of ETH (if <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`paymentToken`</span> is address <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`0x0`</span>) or the corresponding amount of <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`paymentToken`</span> tokens (if the <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`paymentToken`</span> is a valid token address) to the Safe address. Please take a look at the [api/v1/tokens/?gas=True](relay.html#tokens-get) endpoint to see which tokens are accepted for payment by our service.

Otherwise, the response is not valid or it is compromised, and it should not be used any further.

In the context of the Gnosis Safe and our relay services:
- The <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`MasterCopy`</span>, <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`ProxyFactory`</span> and <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`FallbackHandler`</span> should be addresses of a valid deployment of the<span style="color:#DB3A3D">`GnosisSafe`</span> contracts.
- The initializer is the ABI encoded call to <span style="color:#DB3A3D">`GnosisSafe.setup(...)`</span> ([smart contract function](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol#L76)).
