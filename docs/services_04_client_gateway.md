The Safe client gateway is a gateway between the Safe clients on the respective platforms (Android/ iOS/ web) and the Safe backend services ([Transaction service](services_03_transactions.md) including Ethereum nodes). It is providing a more UI-oriented mapping and multi-sourced data structures for ease of integration and rendering. 

Note: This service is meant for use with current Gnosis clients (Android, iOS, Web) exclusively. We do not provide support for external use. If you are looking for external integration, please refer to the ([transaction service](services_03_transactions.md) instead.
