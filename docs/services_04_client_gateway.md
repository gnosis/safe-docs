The Safe client gateway is a gateway between the Safe clients on the respective platforms (Android/ iOS/ web) and the Safe backend services ([Transaction service](services_03_transactions.md) including Ethereum nodes). It is providing a more UI-oriented mapping and multi-sourced data structures for ease of integration and rendering.
