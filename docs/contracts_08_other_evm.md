title: Gnosis Safe on other EVM-based networks
sidebar_label: Other networks
---

The canonical versions of the Gnosis Safe smart contracts are deployed to the following networks:

- Ethereum Mainnet (Etherscan provides a good overview [here](https://etherscan.io/accounts/label/gnosis-safe).)
- Ethereum Testnets: Rinkeby, Kovan, Ropsten, GÃ¶rli
- xDai
- Energy Web Chain
- Energy Web Chain Testnet: Volta

The contract addresses match on all these networks. The full list can be found in the [Safe deployments](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-deployments) repository on Github (e.g. for [v.1.3.0](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-deployments/tree/main/src/assets/v1.3.0)).

To deploy the Gnosis Safe contracts on another EVM-based chain (needs to be fully compatible, e.g. support all opcodes used by the Gnosis Safe contracts) follow the instruction in the Gnosis Safe contract repository [readme](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/v1.3.0/README.md#custom-networks).

In case you are missing the canonical Gnosis Safe contracts for the versions 1.1.1 or 1.2.0 on another EVM-based chain, instructions on how to set them up can be found [here](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contract-deployment-replay).

In order to run the [Gnosis Safe Web interface](gnosis-safe.io/app/) ([Code](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-react/)), you would need to also run the backend services, in particular the [Safe client gateway](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-client-gateway/) and the [Safe transaction service](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-transaction-service) including a tracing node.

At Gnosis, we do not have the capacity to spin up and maintain full frontend and backend support for other EVM-based networks. All our code is open source. We encourage everyone to [deploy the canonical versions](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/v1.3.0/README.md#custom-networks) of the Safe contracts to their respective networks and run the required backend and frontend parts themselves.

To add a supported network to the [Safe deployments](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-deployments) repository follow the steps outlined in the Gnosis Safe contracts repository [readme](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/v1.3.0/README.md#deployments).
