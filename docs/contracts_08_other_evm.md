title: Gnosis Safe on other EVM-based networks
sidebar_label: Other networks
---

The canonical versions of the Gnosis Safe smart contracts are deployed to the following networks:

- Ethereum Mainnet (Etherscan provides a good overview [here](https://etherscan.io/accounts/label/gnosis-safe).)
- Ethereum Testnets: Rinkeby, Kovan, Ropsten, GÃ¶rli
- xDai
- Energy Web Chain
- Energy Web Chain Testnet: Volta

The contract addresses match on all these networks. The full list can be found in the `networks.json` of the respective release in the Gnosis Safe contracts repository on Github (e.g. for [v.1.2.0](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/v1.2.0/networks.json)).

In case you are missing the canonical Gnosis Safe contracts on another EVM-based chain, instructions on how to set them up can be found [here](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contract-deployment-replay).

In order to run the [Gnosis Safe Web interface](gnosis-safe.io/app/) ([Code](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-react/)), you would need to also run the backend services, in particular the [Safe transaction service](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-transaction-service) including a tracing node.

At Gnosis, we do not have the capacity to spin up and maintain full frontend and backend support for other EVM-based networks. All our code is open source. We encourage everyone to [deploy the canonical versions](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contract-deployment-replay) of the Safe contracts to their respective networks and run the required backend and frontend parts themselves. 

Please let us know about any questions at safe@gnosis.io or via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FPMRAwK).
