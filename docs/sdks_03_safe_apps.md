With over $1B worth of digital assets held in Gnosis Multisigs alone, itâ€™s essential for the dapp ecosystem to access the untapped market of multi-signature wallets. Safe Apps introduce a completely new way for developers to build their dapps right into a Multisig interface. Turn your Dapp into an HTML iframe component that can be accessed through the Safe Multisig. We are providing extensive developer tooling to make it easy to develop, test and integrate Safe Apps into the Safe Multisig. This includes a unique design system, reusable components and a Safe App SDK that facilitates the Safe App <> Safe Multisig communication.

Please refer to this [EthCC3 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GirpNHZPJM) to learn more about Safe Apps.

_Safe Apps are currently in development. We will add more details here soon. If you are interested please reach out to us via our [Gnosis Safe Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/FPMRAwK)._
